Add DPU support to GPGPU-Sim

1) Make sure that some benchmakrs run on the current version to use as baseline.
    In particular from ISPASS: CP, DG, LPS, RAY, WP

    Seems than all of the benchmarks pass in the rodinia-2 benchmark

2) What files/ functions should be changed:
    * Configuration files/ option parsers:
        * gpu-sim.cc: add option parser for various things like:
            * gpgpu_operand_collector_num_units_dp                              done  
            * gpgpu_operand_collector_num_in_ports_dp                           done
            * gpgpu_operand_collector_num_out_ports_dp                          done
            * gpgpu_num_dp_units                                                done
        * configs/*/gpgpusim.config
            * Add the proper configuration according to the SP and SFU          done

    * shader.cc:shader_core_ctx() (constructor)                                 done
        * line 216: add collector units for the dpus                            done
        * line 266: add to the total number of function units the dpus          done
        * lines 272-278: for each dpu, add it to the m_fu, add to               done 
        m_dispatch_port and m_issue_port

    * shader.cc:scheduler::cycle()
        * this where the scheduler desides to which function units to issue the
        instructions
        * Here, for DP instructions we should prioritize the DPUs
        * I need a way to tell if the instruction is DP (looking at the opcode)
        * This logic should be added in this fucntion, somewhere in lines 878-920
    
    * shader.cc:swl_scheduler::swl_scheduler() (constructor)                    done
    to all scheduler constructors that take the register_set *sfu_out,          done
    add the DPUs                                                

    * inst.op_pipe should have a category for the DPUs (DP__OP)                 done

    * shader.{cc, h}: add constructor for the dpu                               done
        * similar to sfu::sfu in line 1506                                      done
        * also imlpement the issue function                                     done
        * the active_lanes_in_pipeline()                                        done

    * shader.h: Add the necessary member variables, similarly to SP and SFU     done

    * Statistics:
        * power_stat.{cc, h}:                                                   skipped
            * Similar to the SPs and SFUs.                                      skipped

    * Power:                                                                    
        * At first, I can disable the power estimation and focus on the         skipped
        functional and performance simulation                                   skipped
        * power_interface.{cc, h}:                                              skipped
            * according to lines 90-100, for DPUs                               skipped
        * gpuwattch/gpgpu_sim_wrapper.h lines 84-85                             skipped
        * gpuwattch/core.h: line 489 get_coefficient_sfu_accesses()             skipped
        * gpuwattch/logic.cc: lines 697-698                                     skipped
        * etc.. based on the sfu, dp                                            skipped

3) Things to check for and correct:

    * incsp_stat                                                                done

    * scheduler_unit (add parameter)                                            done
    * operation_pipeline, operation_pipeline_t          
    * F64_TYPE, where it comes from?
    * m_sp_out

4) Assumptions/ need to be revised
    * max_dp_latency == 64 (2* max_sp_latency)
    * Should I add an OP like SFU_OP? I don't thnik so, but have a look
    * special_operations_t, FP__OP
    * Or a uarch operand type?
    * I added an DP__OP enum operation_pipeline{_t}
